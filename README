What

Reads ip addresses with optional prefix from arguments and dumps information
about them.
Aim is to gather all information there is about an internet address and print it
in a readable manner for better understanding. It seems, that ipcalc should provide
this functionality, but on fedora it doesn't.


Examples

$ make all

$ ./ipinfo
Nothing to do.
ipinfo 0.1
Usage: ./ipinfo[OPTION]
	-c, --color	attempts to improve readability by colorizing output. messes up shell redirects.
	-l, --localifs	print local interface addresses
	-v	increase verbosity, can be specified  up to 3 times

$ ./ipinfo  -vv fe80::5054:ff:fec6:cb2d/64

"fe80::5054:ff:fec6:cb2d/64" ->  {
  o link local unicast address. prefix fe80::/10
  o not routed, used for Neighbour Discovery
  o dynamic assignment with EUI64 or random number or manual assignment.
  o all addresses not in range ff00::/8 are unicast addresses. A unicast address can also be used as anycast address.
  o interface id contains an EUI64 unique identifier(RFC 2373). Address was most likely automatically assigned with SLAAC. 
    mac: 52:54:0:c6:cb:2d

  o subnet is: fe80::


  subnet prefix interface id
  11111110 10000000 : 00000000 00000000 : 00000000 00000000 : 00000000 00000000 : ^00001010 01010100 : 00000000 11111111 : 11111110 11000110 : 11001011 00101101
}

$ ./ipinfo -v  ff01::1

"ff01::1" ->  {
  o permanent multicast address. prefix ff00::/8. scope: node local
    | ff | 4bits-flag | 4bits-scope | 112 bits group id |.
    IANA assigned multiast address: node local all nodes address
